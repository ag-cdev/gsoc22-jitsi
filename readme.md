## Project Goal:

*Multiple Recording Storage Providers. Jitsi is a open source software that is used for video calls as per the trend the video calls are becoming very popular and for many reasons people need to record their calls and they prefer to store them in easy to access services like dropbox, s3 buckets, box, etc. The goal of the project was to establish a mechanism (implemented  in python) which will handle the upload of the files.*

## Major Tasks
- Implementing the s3. (Goal of the project was  at first to only integrate s3 uploads of the files and have a config file as well).
- Implementing the dropbox, box.
